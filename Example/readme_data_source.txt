Data Source:

The example datasets (i.e., walk, car and airborne surveys) were collected by JAEA in Fall 2013.
The datasets are publicly available in the JAEA data website (http://emdb.jaea.go.jp/emdb/en/).
A subset of datasets were selected in a small domain near Fukushima City for the demonstration purpose.
